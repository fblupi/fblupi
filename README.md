### Hi there 👋 I'm fblupi 

- 👨‍💻 I’m currently working as a Software Engineer at [Nazaríes IT](https://www.nazaries.com). I ❤️ RoR, but I've got experience with other technologies and languages. I previously worked with Computer Graphics too. You can check out [3DCurator](https://github.com/fblupi/3DCurator): a desktop application to visualize volumetric datasets of Polychromed Wood Sculptures.
- 🔭 I’m currently learning and developing my knowledge on numerous back-end technologies such as Ruby on Rails and I would like to learn about some trending front-end technologies.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can find me in every social network with the nickname _fblupi_ except on my email: francisco.bolivar.lupianez@gmail.com
