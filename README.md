### Hi there 👋 I'm fblupi 

- 🔭 I’m currently working as full-stack web developer at Nazaríes IT (from 🏠). I ❤️ RoR, but I've got experience with other languages like PHP. When people ask me if I prefer front or back (don't think bad 🌚) I usually answer "back" although I enjoy with Angular projets too.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and developing my knowledge on numerous back-end technologies such as Ruby on Rails and I would like to learn about some trending front-end technologies (mainly React ⚛️).
- 💬 Ask me about web development or Computer Graphics.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can find me in every social network with the nickname _fblupi_ except on my email: francisco.bolivar.lupianez@gmail.com
